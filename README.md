This project is about creating an RC robot that conceals all of the electronics inside it's body.
The plan is to use 3D printing and laser cutting to construct this robot.

## Remember
Directions for plugging in wires can be found at:

When plugging in the regulator, make sure to line up the wire colors.
Never run the Pi with the regulator and USB power at the same time.

To get on the Pi:
1) unplug from the regulator chip (if attached)
2) plug in special power cable
3) plug in yellow ethernet cable
4) wait a few seconds
5) open VNC viewer and double click RPi Wired
6) config files are in the driver folder, assuming pi hasn't been altered
